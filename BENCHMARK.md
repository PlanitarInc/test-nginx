Note: the tests are performed on the server machine itself:
 - in case of apache server: the tests are run on the same machine running apache
 - in case of ec2 instances: the tests are run on the same machine running nginx

## Apache server

This is our reference point, the simplest configuration ever:
Apache serving static files on 2-Core 1.6GHz Intel Atom with 2GB RAM.
